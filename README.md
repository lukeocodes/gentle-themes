## Installation

1. Open **Extensions** sidebar panel in VS Code. `View â†’ Extensions`
2. Search for `Gentle Themes` - find the one by **LukeOCodes**
3. Click **Install** to install it.
4. Code > Preferences > Color Theme - find one of the Gentle themes

## Accessibility

Work in progress. Build in line with [this guide](https://css-tricks.com/creating-a-vs-code-theme/), the idea is to produce themes that don't make dark or light theme fans recoil when it is changed mid stream.

Again, work in progress. Light mode is coming. Dark modes were the low hanging fruit.

## Demos
